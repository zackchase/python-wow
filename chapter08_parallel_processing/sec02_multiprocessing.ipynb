    "As computing hardware manufacturers add more cores to computer processors and multi-core processors becoming the norm even with personal computers and laptops, creating parallelizable code becomes very important. Python introduced the `multiprocessing` module to let us write parallel processing code to leverage the capabilities of multi-core CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** - Improvement due to parallel processing is mostly noticable only if the tasks at hand are cpu-bound where the majority of the time is spent in the CPU in contrast to I/O bound tasks, where most of the time is spent reading and writing data from the disk."

    "##### Multithreading vs Multiprocessing\n",
    "With multithreading, jobs are submitted to different threads, and it will behave more like subtasks of a single process. The different threads run in the same shared memory space, so care needs to be taken so that different threads do not write in the same memory location. In Python multithreading is not true parallelization, since it does not bypass the Global Interpreter Lock and the parallelization is achieved using a time slicing mechanism. So the multiple threads will run on a single core of the processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiprocessing, each process has its own separate memory, so memory management is easier. But inter-process communication will be costlier because every object that is passed between processes needs to be pickled and unpickled. Also spawning a new process can be costlier than spawning a new thread. Both these overheads need to be taken into account while contemplating multiprocessing vs multithreading. Unlike multithreading, in multiprocessing the different processes runs on different cores of the processor, so it effectively bypasses Python's Global Interpreter Lock, hence achieving true parallelization. So if you want to max out the resources in a multi-core machine then using the `multiprocessing` module is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to compare and benchmark multithreading and multiprocessing in different scenarios with a few practise probelms in the next notebook."
