    "# Practice Questions on Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a bunch of questions aimed at verifying that you know things about literals, variables, strings, ints, floats, and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 Identify the types of each of the following literals\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"apple\"\n",
    "1\n",
    "\"1\"\n",
    "1.1\n",
    "False\n",
    "1.0\n",
    "1.1\n",
    "\"1.0\"\n",
    "True\n",
    "None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Add 1 line of code below each comment to perform the tasks specified in the comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the text in `x` to all caps and print to screen\n",
    "2. Convert the text in `y` to all lowercase and print to screen\n",
    "3. Concatenate `x` and `y` and print the result to screen\n",
    "4. Concatenate `x` and `y` using `+`, adding one space between them and print to screen. \n",
    "5. Perform the same task but using Python string formatting with `%`. See examples --- https://www.learnpython.org/en/String_Formatting"

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called \"my_string\" and assign the value \"Miles Davis (Vol. 2)\" to it.\n",
    "2. What do you expect to see if you call my_string.upper()?\n",
    "3. We just called `.upper()` -- this is function associated with specific object. What is the term for such a function?\n",
    "4. After calling `.upper()`, what is the value of the `my_string` variable?\n",
    "5. Assign the value reference by `my_string` to a new variable called `new_string`. Now run `my_string = \"Water Babies\"`. Has the value of `new_string` changed? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Casting \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `x` and assign it the value 3.3\n",
    "2. Create a variable called `y` and assign it the value `\"4.2\"`\n",
    "4. What datatype is `x`? What data type is `y`?\n",
    "3. Can you compose the two together with the `+`? Why or why not?\n",
    "5. What do we need to do to, and to which variable, before we can concatenate the two values?\n",
    "6. What do we need to do to, and to which variable, before we can *sum* the two values?\n",
    "7. For each of the following, can we cast it to a string? \n",
    " * \"apple\"\n",
    " * \"4.5\"\n",
    " * 9.2\n",
    " * 11\n",
    " * 2.\n",
    "8. For each of the following can we cast it to an int?\n",
    " * 3.3\n",
    " * 3\n",
    " * \"apple\"\n",
    "9. For each of the following can we cast it to a float?\n",
    " * 3.3\n",
    " * 3\n",
    " * \"apple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given an integer `x` and integer `y`, what is the type of `x+y`? `x-y`? `x*y`? `x/y`? \n",
    "2. Why is type of the division operator different than that of its operands?\n",
    "2. Python 2 and many older languages handle integer division differently, truncating the decimal portion of the result. How do we run older-style integer division in Python 3?\n",
    "3. Write an expression to perform older-style int division dividing `9` by `25`.\n",
    "4. Write an expression using just basic Python to raise 9 to the 5th power.\n",
    "5. Do the same but using the `pow` function from the `math` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boolean logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the two allowable Boolean literals? \n",
    "2. Assume that `p` and `q` are Python variables taking Boolean values, write Python expressions corresponding to the following the following logic expressions\n",
    " * $\\neg p$\n",
    " * $p$ AND $q$\n",
    " * $p$ OR $q$\n",
    " * $p$ XOR $q$\n",
    " * $p$ NAND $q$\n",
    " \n",
    "## General knowledge \n",
    "1. What is a programming language?\n",
    "2. What is the difference between a compiled and scripted language and which is Python 3? \n",
    "3. What are some advantages and disadvantages (in general) of scripted vs compiled languages?\n",
    "4. You write a Python program to generate a compiled C program. And you can write a C program that serves as a Python interpreter. Does that mean that all languages are the same? Why or why not?"
