If you put this print statement in a script and then run it from the terminal, the program will output `\"Hello\"` right on the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here `print` is an example of a function. Functions (often called subroutines, e.g. [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine)) are blocks of instructions that we want to execute many times. Thus we define them once, in one place and then reference them each time we want to *invoke* them. We'll elaborate more on functions when we get to that portion of the tutorial, but basically functions take some input (optionally none), execute some instructions (lines of code), and then produce some output (optionally none).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've been passing the `print` function text strings and it has been executing code to print that text to the screen. The `print` function **does not return any values**, but it's very flexible in what kinds of values it takes as input: numbers, variables, lists, and more complex objects. We've only been using `print` so far to print *string literals*. In the coming sections we'll go deeper into what a literal means, how functions work, and how to define our own functions. \n",
